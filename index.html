<p style="margin: 80px;">The wolf (Canis lupus; pl.: wolves), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine native to Eurasia
    and North America. More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, including the dog and dingo,
    though gray wolves, as popularly understood, only comprise naturally-occurring wild subspecies. The wolf is the
    largest extant member of the family Canidae, and is further distinguished from other Canis species by its less
    pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely
    enough to smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them. The
    wolf's fur is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black, although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly
    all white.</p>
